# Heart-Failure-Prediction
People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies.

The dataset contains 12 clinical features each representing one factor that could lead to heart failure

All features have been dealt with data cleaning, feature engg, one-hot encoding, standard data scaling and outliers have been dropped to make the data look more useful.

EDA, being the most integral part of an analysis, have been used to check the correlation between all 12 variables and find out if they produce bias before applying them to the model. Also, multicollinearity has been done. 

For modelling, i have used both Logistic regression and Knn to check which one will prvide better results and accuracy.
